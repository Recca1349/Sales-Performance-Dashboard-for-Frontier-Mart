December had the highest sales volume. Capitalize on this by launching seasonal promotions, bundling offers, and loyalty programs ahead of the holiday peak.

**Promote the Household & Cleaning Category :**
With $2.3M in sales, this was the top-performing category. Focus promotional efforts here, while also identifying underperforming categories for repositioning.

**Encourage Online Payments & Wholesaler Sales :**
Since Online payments account for 51.7% of transactions and Wholesalers bring in the most revenue, improve payment convenience and strengthen B2B partnerships.

**Monitor Low-Performing Months :**
Months like May and February showed lower sales. Investigate causes (e.g., seasonality, stock issues) and introduce targeted promotions or product launches during these periods.

**Leverage Data for Demand Forecasting :**
Use monthly trends and product performance to create accurate demand forecasts—minimizing overstock or stockouts and improving supply chain efficiency.

**Optimize Product Mix :**
Review products like ClearWash Gel, which had high sales but relatively low profit margins. Consider price adjustments, bundling, or marketing strategies to improve profitability.
